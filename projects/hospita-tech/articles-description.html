        <h2>Healthcare It - Challenges and Emerging Trends/Oportunities</h2>
        <p>Healthcare IT is a framework to describe the comprehensive management of health information across computerized systems and its secure exchange of data between consumers, providers, government and quality entities, and insurers. Health information technology (HIT) is in general, increasingly viewed as the most promising tool for improving the overall quality, safety and efficiency of the health delivery system. While Healthcare IT has a major role to play in contribution to the Medical Fraternity, it has its own set of Challenges and Opportunities.</p>
        <div class="articles-description">
        <h3>Challenges Faced</h3>
        <div class="bulate">
        	<ul style="list-style: none;">
            	<li>
                	<div class="bulate-num">
                        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                            <li><strong>Standardization of Policies & Procedures: </strong><br>One of the biggest Challenges in the Healthcare IT is the standardization of a HMS (Healthcare Management Software) available in the market. This is largely due the fact that there are no standard regulatory norms that govern the Hospital industry. Hospitals are run by different legal entities like Trust, Private or Corporate. Each hospital has its unique set of Policies and Procedures, which makes it difficult to have a standard software to be designed by any company.</li>
                            
                            <li><strong>Lack of Integration with TPA: </strong><br>The other challenge faced is lack of Integration with the TPA or Insurance companies. The onus of coordinating with the TPA or Insurance companies primarily is on the patient/patient's relatives, who have to run from Pillar to Post to get the sanctions. The need of the hour is to have seamlessly integrated HMS software with the Insurance companies, which will enable cashless transaction and make the journey of the patients to the hospitals less stressful and convenient.</li>
                            
                            <li><strong>Privacy of Data: </strong><br>There is a lot of onus on the Healthcare IT department to maintain the privacy of data of the patients who are being treated in their hospitals. Patient's data is highly confidential and vulnerable of getting leaked. Adequate care should be taken to maintain the privacy of patient data by creating roles and rights for the people accessing the data.</li>
                            
                            <li><strong>Data Management: </strong> <br>With the Digitization of records, introduction of PACS and EMR/EHR, the IT department has to manage large amount of data than it was managing few years ago. Procurement of storage devices, management of data and integrating with HMS is a potential challenge.</li>

                            <li> <h3>Healthcare Analytics:</h3>
                            	<div class="bulate">

                                     		<li><strong>Emerging Trends</strong><br>Healthcare industry are now being revolutionized and transformed with the entrants of healthcare analytics.Analytics provide the mechanism to sort complex dataand help healthcare organizations deliver on these demands. Healthcare organizations are increasingly depending on analytics to consume, unlock and apply new insights from information. New methods of analytics can be used to drive clinical and operational improvements to meet business challenges. From a traditional approach of transaction monitoring using conventional reporting tools, spreadsheets and application reporting modules, analytics in healthcare are moving towards a model that will eventually incorporate predictive analytics and enable organizations to "see the future," create more personalized healthcare, allow dynamic fraud detection and predict patient behaviour</li>
                                            
                                            
                                     		<li><strong>Opportunities</strong><br>Thereis an opportunity for the Healthcare IT to make the application more responsive on portable devices like tablets and smart phones to encourage more and more people to use the product, and ensure that the tool is optimally utilized.</li>
                                     </ul>

                            <li><h3>Mobile Health:</h3>
                            	<div class="bulate">
                               		 <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
                                     		<li><strong>Emerging Trends</strong><br>Also known as mHealth, it is the delivery of healthcare services via mobile communication devices. mHealth applications include the use of mobile devices in collecting community and clinical health data, delivery of healthcare information to practitioners, researchers, and patients, real-time monitoring of patient  vital signs, and direct provision of care.</li>
                                     		<li><strong>Opportunities</strong><br>The opportunity for mobile health developers is clear. With a growing market and interest in improving health care from the perspective of both, the patient as well as the provider, the market is aligned to make the promise of mobile health a reality. New initiatives such as Apple HealthKit and Google Fit have instantly made massive platforms available to connect consumers to better health care through connected apps.
The need of health care providers and payers to reduce costs will drive the demand for new mobile health solutions by the industry in the coming years. The growing trend in healthcare wearable's(pedometers, Wrist watches monitoring your vitals) and health apps will fuel interest from consumers. Apps developers who can help providers and patients improve compliance to prescribed regimens and reduce costs.</li>

                            	<div class="bulate">
                               		 <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
                                     		<li><strong>Emerging Trends</strong><br>Mobile medical apps can be seen nowadays in every smart phone today and have become a part of our everyday routine. The increasing awareness of health and fitness has generated people to become health conscious and thereby enabling them to use these apps and devices to monitor their health and fitness levels.  Both doctors and patients are finding that mobile apps can provide a fast and efficient way to stay in touch and exchange information. Among the innovative mobile medical apps we found is one that enables doctors to use interactive diagrams, to show patients what's happening with their bodies, where procedures will be done, and exactly what will happen during different procedures. Alternatively, patients can use these apps to get doctors to provide detailed visual answers to their questions.</li>
                                            
                                     		<li><strong>Opportunities</strong><br>Most mobile health apps today are like islands which don't interact with other applications nor are integrated with the HMS. This lack of integration can be transformed effectively into an opportunity by exploring an integration with core HMS.</li>
