                  <p>No wonder it is one of the highly rated Chinese restaurant in the city - from cleanliness to ambience and from service to taste and quality, everything was absolutely top notch! I have been to their outlets too but the chain of Mainland China whether it is staff behaviour or food quality, they never fail to impress. Truly one of the most authentic Chinese restaurants in India!</p>

                  <p>Started the New Year on a good note by going for dinner at Mainland China! This is one of my favourite places, extremely consistent in their food and service. Great place to start the New Year by trying out their new menu. I ordered for my all time favourite crab meat soup and then Philadelphia sushi, smoked salmon with cream cheese and avocado, totally loved it. Next on our platter was juicy minced meat rolls, just perfect. Amazing food, this place is always packed and their service is impeccable. When I can not think of any other place I end up here.</p>

                  <p>Mainland china is quite a famous place. In fact, it is one of the first names that pops in your mind when you think of Chinese cuisine. I visited with my dad and being an ardent lover of Chinese cuisine, he just adored the food and ambience.</p>
                  <p>Fresh soups, huge array of starters and mains and mouth watering desserts on the buffet! It was a straightforward slurp and burp scenario.</p>
                  <p>I must leave a special note for our server for the day –Mr. Pradeep. He was gracious and polite. He attended to our every need with the biggest possible smile. Kudos to the staff!</p>

                  <p>When I lived in Kolkata, I never thought of going to this place. I've been to each and every restaurant of the Speciality Group, but never to this place as my mother can cook each and every item which is in the menu. However, after I shifted to Hyderabad, I realized how much I missed Bengali food especially during Pujo. So, I finally visited Oh! Calcutta to celebrate the starting of Debi Pokkho and yes, we had Topshe Maacher Cutlet with Mustard Sauce followed by Steamed Rice, Jhur Jhure Aloo Bhaja, Mochar Ghonto and Khulna Chingrir Curry. It was mind blowing and made me feel so nostalgic. <strong>Thank you Oh! Calcutta for giving me a taste of home.</strong></p>

                  <p>The best place for Bongs away from home, serving authentic Bengali cuisine in an environment reminiscent of all things dear to them! The restaurant has a classy decor, walls adorned with known faces from the world of Bengali cinema and literature, accompanied by soothing old songs playing in the background. On each table, they have beautiful plates with the silhouette of our beloved Kolkata sketched on it, which are taken away when food is served. We started off with Topsher Cutlet, and then moved on to Borishaler Chingri Pulao, Daab Chingri and Ilish Paturi. The highlight was definitely the Daab Chingri. I wish I can keep coming again and again.</p>

                  <p>This place is all about class. The moment you'll enter in this place you'll get that vibe. If you're looking for some authentic Bengali food, then this is a must recommended visit for you.</p>
                  <p>Appetizing starters like Gondhoraj Bhapa Murgi and Murshidabadi Murgi and main course such as Rajbarir Chanar Kofta, Grand Trunk Chicken, Chingri Malai Curry – there is so much that you won't get enough! Not to forget, Nolen Gur Ice cream is a personal favourite!</p>

                  <p>"Please come back" - This summarises the way we were treated and the quality of food. The flavours of the Bhetki Fish Curry and the 5 spice mix vegetable was so so good, it was over before we finished the roti! The food is totally melt-in-your-mouth quality!</p>
                  <p>After a long time I had a different form of regional Indian cuisine in a true sense. The flavour was different and the staff (absolutely fantastic service) was more than eager to help us out with what to order. <strong>I can't wait to go back.</strong></p>

                  <p><strong>Authenticity and Class</strong> These are the two words which are diminishing in the restaurants due to more commercial approach. Oh Calcutta (Bengali Cuisines) is the place where these two words aren't compromised at all. The items here are in such big numbers that you need to visit this place multiple times to relish them. I was very fortunate that I was with a friend who had an extensive knowledge of the items. My experience and taste buds screamed out for more food even when we were done eating. Truly fantastic!</p>

                  <p> Chinese cuisines are based in the beauty of harmony and variation.</p>
                  <p>Truly, for many friends who have not had authentic Chinese food, this is their first opportunity to understand and appreciate at Asia Kitchen by Mainland China. Truly rich in flavours and varieties, it is one of the best Asian food places in Chennai. I would say, "Better than even most countries of Asia!"</p>

                  <p>It was almost 11 in the night and we were one of the last few guests in the restaurant. The manager came to us and told us to be free and order anything we want and inform him for any complaints. That was an extremely polite gesture by him - something that we don't get to see when we enter late into the restaurant.</p>
                  <p>Overall, I loved their hospitality and food. Extremely courteous staff and lovely food.</p>

                  <p>A fad for all food lovers. Sigree Global Grill is the perfect place for a stomach full of experience and an unforgettable buffet. The grilled prawns, seekh kebab and mutton kebabs were just mind blowing! From the succulent mutton curry, chicken, biryani, to a decadent array of desserts, we were just so happy to try it all. The staff was very generous and polite and there was retro music keeping the ambience alive.</p>

                  <p>Nothing would stop you to say that this is the best barbeque buffet, noot only in Kalyan Nagar but also in Bengaluru – one of the flagship brands of Speciality Restaurants. I am fairly regular at their Powai branch in Mumbai. And even in Bangalore, it was a great experience. This shows how consistent they are with their offerings. I visited them during their Bengali Food Festival and it was a refreshing change to their original menu and palette. Wow!</p>

                  <p>Dear Speciality Team <br>
                    Before I go into the details, a big THANK YOU to all of you for a wonderful experience once again at Café Mezzuna, South City, Kolkata.</p>
                  <p>As a family we had stopped visiting the cafe in South City, Kolkata since our bad experiences in May this year. On the 22nd September 2018, we thought let us try again considering our continued good experiences at Café Mezzuna, Forum. When we entered, we were received so well, we noticed a large majority of the staff had changed and they all seemed happy. We were served very well and the food was delicious and fresh. My son did not have any upset stomach the way he did the few times we had eaten at the Cafe in May. I was observing the way the staffs were behaving with other customers and I must say - they were awesome. Thank you so much and I am definitely treating my friends here on my birthday.</p>
                  <p>On 28th September, we visited Spicery for the first time. Had a wonderful experience, food was good for me (I don't eat much of spicy food so couldn't taste much of it) but my husband really enjoyed every dish we ordered. My son could not eat the food as even the Malai Kabab was spicy for him (he enjoys his Siu Mai and Fried Rice at Mainland China or Asia Kitchen) but I specially thank the staff who went out of the way to ensure he got a plate of momos which are usually served only during the snacks hours. As usual, with all your restaurants - very polite and efficient staff.</p>
                  <p>Yesterday the 1st October we had an awesome experience at Mainland China, South City Mall.</p>
                  <p>Thank you to all of you and keep it up. <br>
                    Regards</p>

                  <p>The presentation of the liquor and alcohol based items really kill it. It's visually stunning and is quite at par in terms of taste. The LIIF (Long Island Ice Freeze) is a recommend. I also happen to like the Bath Tub and of course, Baileys. It can never disappoint.</p>

                  <p>PROGRESSIVE ORIENTAL HOUSE – MUMBAI is basically one the best outlets for authentic Asian cuisine. They have the finest interiors and the finest staff in town. They are the best in this business. The ambience of the place is also good. Their staff is so much co-operative as well as understanding and specially Mr. Keith who helped us a lot during our visit at POH, Mumbai. What a glorious experience I had!</p>

                  <p><strong style="display:inline-block">In one sentence: Culinary delight of the highest order.</strong> One of the most authentic SEA (South East Asian) restaurants I have been to.</p>
                  <p>Had lunch with friends here y'day. Everything about yesterday's experience was brilliant.</p>
                  <p><strong>Food</strong></p>
                  <p>We directly went for the mains course where we tried the famous Singapore Chilli Crab, Braised chicken with shiitake & Khow Suey. All the dishes were brilliant - delectable authentic SEA flavours, elegant and classy presentation and decent sized portions (unlike most other high-end restaurants).</p>
                  <p>The dessert menu sounded just like an inspiration out of a MasterChef Gourmet list. It was a difficult task to decide which one to go for. Finally we ordered the 'Nuts & Bolts' and ' Spiced Poached Apple'. It's a very interesting combination of flavours. The Nuts and Bolts had actual nuts and bolts made of bitter chocolate combined with some other interesting ingredients. It turned out to be a bit too bitter for our taste. The spiced poached apple combined with walnut ice-cream, basil, apple leather and many more ingredients was simply amazing.</p>
                  <p><strong>Service</strong></p>
                  <p>Was blown away by the courteous staff. Arvind, who was taking care of us was a delight to interact with. He helped us make the difficult choices from a very interesting menu. There was a right balance of attentiveness along with giving three gals their space to chat away :-)</p>
                  <p>Overall a wonderful experience!</p>

                  <p>The ambience was nice, chic and comfortable, the service being great and the food was excellent. The meal began with a rice based crispy amuse-bouche which exploded into flavours as it popped in the mouth. Then came the Waterchestnut and Avocado Salad which was nice, but which left scope for more to be done with its ingredients. One of my favourites of the evening were the crispy Lotus stems which was spicy by itself, but when eaten with the frothy soya cream that engulfed it, tasted simply divine!</p>

Firstly, the decor is quite nicely done and most of the kids would fall in love with the place. Lighting is super dim with a green grassy carpet all over the floor, hanging vines and creepers from the ceiling, waterfall with changing lights, figures of Mowgli and his mates from the Jungle book, a flight of stairs leading to a cozy mezzanine floor and occasional sounds of thunder and roar in the air set the mood for a nice time with friends or family. The bar is separated from the main dining area so it's safe to take your kids along. The seating is comfortable with enough space to accommodate large groups. The menu is quite detailed and every item is explained properly. Coming to the food, we liked everything we were served. All in all, quite a unique experience.</p>

                  <p>Spicery, a name which should make all street food lovers go crazy! Yes, it's a hub of Indian Street food. We started with Lucknow's Tunday Kebab, and how can I explain the melt in the mouth experience, it was smooth, fragrant and full of flavours! Next up we ordered a North Kolkata Prawn Cutlets, there were three standard sized cutlets, they tasted pretty well, but it didn't satisfy my expectations, as it had been made from minced prawn meat. Third, we tried their day's special Murgh angara kebab, it was a tawa kebab and it tasted more like a south indian version of hariyali kebab, it had whole black peppercorns, so it was pretty spicy ! Lastly to balance the spicy of the last dish we ordered a Murgh Malai Kebab, and bam! That was it, succulent pieces of chicken with Malai on top and the sigree's flavour too it! Woof it was almost melting in mouth, so soft and tender it was!</p>

                  <p>I recommended this place to all the foodies.</p>

                  <p>Dariole the Patisserie has become my most favourite place. Tried the cake which was super soft, moist and chocolatey. Made me go mmmm! I was very touched and impressed! Strongly recommend this for snacks and pastries! </p>

                  <p>Was craving some dessert and soon as we spotted this cute cafe on our way. Dariole has a neat ambience with a wide range of pastries, buns, shakes etc. The Eclairs here is a must try. It was served warm on request.

                  <p>The latest entrant in the confectionery cum coffee shop scenario in Kolkata by Speciality Restaurants! This one serves eggless pastries, cookies, puffs and patties and what not! One can also enjoy tea and coffee in this small, cozy area with aesthetic, minimalistic decor. Worth a recommend!</p>

                  <p>Visited this relatively new place a few days back and I am glad I did! The decor is quiet, simple and minimalistic. This place serves a wide variety of pastries and patties which are very unique such as the kosha mangsho puff, prawn Malai puff, etc. Yum!</p>

                  <p>Dariole was on my list for a long time and finally I paid a visit. Dariole means a small cup shaped mould in which a dessert is prepared.
