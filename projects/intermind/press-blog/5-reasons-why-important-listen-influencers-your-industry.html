  <h3>Here are 5 reasons why it is crucial to listen to influencers for your industry. </h3>
        <div class="grid-6">
          <ul>
            <li class="wow animated fadeIn" data-wow-delay="0.3s" data-wow-offset="20"><strong>Wide and Loyal Audience</strong>
              All social media influencers carry along with them a large Twitter following, long Facebook friends list or heavy blog traffic which means that through them you can reach a wide audience. If they mention your brand name, talk about it or retweet or share your posts, they are automatically channelling your brand communication to a huge audience.</li>
            <li class="wow animated fadeIn" data-wow-delay="0.3s" data-wow-offset="20"><strong>Excellent Networks</strong>
              Influencers are good at networking and build up impressive networks. Their contacts engage in conversations or discussions on the various subjects the influencers post about, which can lead to more brand building. Moreover, the contacts share or retweet these posts which means that your audience multiplies, increasing your visibility. Also, through them you can identify other influential people as well, who are a part of their audience. They can in turn influence their own audience's opinion of your brand.<br>Influencers get the message across to the people in their network, who in turn send it to their own audience, and so on, thus resulting in a snowball effect by reaching out to a much wider audience.</li>
            <li class="wow animated fadeIn" data-wow-delay="0.3s" data-wow-offset="20"><strong>Content</strong>
             In a <a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/influence-survey/vocus-brian-solis/prweb4582264.htm" target="_blank" class="links">survey conducted by Vocus and Brian Solis</a>, 62% of the respondents said that they follow an influencer because of the content they create. The quality of the content is crucial to any marketing campaign. Influencers have the knack of creating great content that would easily strike a chord with the audience, and thereby reduce your work. They might even come up with creative ideas for content marketing that your brand itself did not think of. Some influencers post reviews of your products and services, features, and quality, some may simply write stories related to your brand, and so on.</li>
            <li class="wow animated fadeIn" data-wow-delay="0.3s" data-wow-offset="20"><strong>Credibility</strong>
              Influencers have the immense quality of credibility. This is one of the most important factors responsible for their large following. In the same survey, 51% of the respondents said that they follow an influencer because they consider them as opinion leaders and 40% follow them because of their relationship with the influencer. <br>The expertise these influencers hold in a particular field combined with the good relations they maintain with their audience makes them reliable and trustworthy to people. Their opinion of a brand will most likely become the general opinion among their audience. A word from an influencer can be crucial in making or breaking your brand.</li>
              
            <li class="wow animated fadeIn" data-wow-delay="0.3s" data-wow-offset="20"><strong>New Trends & Insights</strong>
              It is the Influencers who are active online, that come to know early of the latest trends of the evolving social media platforms. They are also among the first to try these new trends, the firsts to discover new platforms to reach and engage with their audience. Through them, you too could get to know about the new trends and ideas and make use of them to build up your customer base. As they are the experts in the field, you could gain from deeper insights about your industry from them.</li>
