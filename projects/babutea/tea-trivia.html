				<ul class="list_style_2" data-aos="fade-right">
					<li>Tea was discovered by accident when in 2737 BC, <strong>Shen Nung, an ancient Chinese emperor</strong> was boiling his drinking water and some tea leaves fell into it from a nearby tea bush. The emperor was pleasantly surprised with its flavour and restorative properties, and then and there the habit of tea drinking was born</li>
<li>Tea was a <strong>national secret of China</strong> and everybody was forbidden with the threat of death from ever selling the tea tree  or knowledge of tea growing </li>
<li>Tea was a <strong>monopoly of China</strong> for many centuries</li>
<li>By the 1720s, European maritime trade with China was dominated by exchange of silver for tea. As prices continued to drop, tea became increasingly popular, and by 1750 had become the<strong> British national drink</strong></li>
<li>The exchange of <strong>silver for tea</strong> nearly bankrupted the British Empire and they desperately searched a way to find a commodity they could sell to China. This product they found in opium, and the trade in opium led to the Opium wars</li>
<li>While waging war on China was one of Britain's tactics, it also began to explore, then executed, a plan to use <strong>India for growing tea</strong></li>
<li>As an attempt to circumvent its dependence on Chinese tea, the East India Company sent <strong>Scottish botanist Robert Fortune to China </strong>to purchase and bring out of China tea trees , which were then taken to India to develop tea plantations</li>
<li>After tea trees were smuggled out of China, plantations were established in areas such as <strong>Darjeeling, Assam, and Ceylon</strong></li>
<li>In Japan, formal ritual drinking of tea is a <strong>Zen Buddhist ritual</strong></li>
<li>The imposition of tax on tea sparked the Boston Tea Party and actually culminated in the <strong>American War of Independence</strong></li>
<li>During the<strong> Second World War, </strong>US army men were surprised by the British tradition of taking a break from war during teatime!</li>
<li><strong>Chai pe charcha</strong> is a very popular radio programme where the Indian Prime Minister addresses fellow countrymen and speaks of current events and plans<br><br></li>
