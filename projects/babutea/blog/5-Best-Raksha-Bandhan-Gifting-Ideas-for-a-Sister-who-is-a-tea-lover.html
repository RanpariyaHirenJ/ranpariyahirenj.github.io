		<p class="p-large" >Raksha Bandhan is celebrated across India and now it's spreading across the world. On this auspicious occasion, sisters tie a rakhi (a sacred thread), to her brother's wrist and pray for his health, happiness, goodwill, and prosperity. In return, brothers will vow to protect her lifelong and gift their sisters something special.  With so many options available it's become tough to decide what to gift your sister with every passing year. But for a sister, who cannot do without her daily cup of tea, gifting her some exotic tea blends or tea accessories can be a great idea.</p>		
        <h3>Here are the top 5 gifting ideas</h3>
        <ul class="numberul">
        	<li>
            	<strong>Tea blends</strong>
                <p>Tea blending is all about balancing the flavors. Understanding flavors is very important in tea blending. The delicate flavors can be lost easily if paired with strong flavors. A good tea blend comprises of some main constituents like base teas, spices, fruits, flowers, and herbs.</p>
                <p><strong>Base Teas :</strong> Black tea, Assam Black Tea, Darjeeling Black Tea, Green Tea, etc</p>
                <p><strong>Spices :</strong> Cinnamon, Star anise, Cloves, dried ginger, etc</p>
                <p><strong>Fruits :</strong> Berries, Orange, Apple, lemon, Pineapple, etc</p>
                <p><strong>Flowers :</strong> Lavender, Chamomile, Jasmine, etc.</p>
                <p><strong>Herbs :</strong> Mint, Lemongrass, Sage, thyme, basil, etc</p>
                <p>There are many varieties of tea blends available in the market which can be purchased directly from the store or can be ordered online.</p>
            </li>
        	<li>
                <strong>Tea Mugs</strong>
                <p>Mugs can be the perfect gift given to anyone regardless of choice. When your sister will drink her daily chai in the tea mug gifted by you, she will surely remember you in every sip. There are tea mugs to choose from, available in various designs and prints in the market and online.  You can also personalize the tea mug with a picture of both of you or any other photo of your choice.</p>
            </li>
        	<li>
            	<strong>Detox Tea</strong>
                <p>To feel the best version of you, you need to detox & cleanse your body. With a stressful daily routine, detox tea (green tea, white tea, etc.) will not only give your sister a much-needed break but will also ensure that she's having a healthy & rejuvenating drink.  It will help her increase strength, improve stamina, aid in weight loss, improve skin texture, and improve immunity.</p>
            </li>
        	<li>
            	<strong>Tea Maker</strong>
                <p>For a flawlessly balanced brew, you need steep different teas for different time duration.  There are different types of tea makers available in the market with some amazing features, you can select the one which suits you the best. You can even come up with your own unique flavors & aromas by setting custom timers and temperature. Every tea lover would die for this gift!</p>
            </li>
        	<li>
            	<strong>Tea infused cosmetics</strong>
                <p>This is gaining popularity, since these days people are getting diverted towards vegan, natural, cruelty-free & organic cosmetics. These products include a variety of soaps, lip balms, creams, lotions, body butter and so many more varieties which are infused with tea. The tea is added with the right mixture of ingredients, enthralling tea lovers to enjoy their favorite blends in a newfangled way.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>If your sister is a tea lover, then these are the perfect gifts for her this Rakhi.</strong></p>
