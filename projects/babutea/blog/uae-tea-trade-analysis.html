		<p>United Arab Emirates is a strategically located nation, also referred to as the gateway to the Middle East countries. Rapid development, modern infrastructure and aggressive focus on trade has resulted in United Arab Emirates being counted among the financial superpowers.</p>
        <p>The domestic consumption of food & beverages in UAE is mainly dependant on the food imports from the neighbouring countries</p>
        
        <h3>Looking at the Tea trade analysis of UAE we observe the following facts -</h3>
        <ul class="numberul">

            </li>
            <li>
            	<strong>UAE Tea exports:</strong>
                <p>Large quantity of teas from UAE is supplied to Russia, Iraq, Iran, Egypt, Ukraine. Due to the flexible trade norms, favourable taxation policies & strategic geographical location UAE is a re- export hub for many commodities including tea.</p>

                <p>UAE Government has taken an initiative to form DMCC (Dubai Multi commodities Centre) This has a dedicated section for tea trade. DMCC provides facilities like warehousing, blending and packing of tea.</p>
                <p>Many tea suppliers from India and Sri lanka have established a presence in DMCC to enhance the market and gain easy access to other middle eastern nations through reexport. Lot of private label packing work happens in DMCC free trade zone for various tea brands in Europe, Russia etc.</p>
                <p>Technological advancements and innovations in terms of processing & value additions of tea is the key focus at DMCC.</p>
                <p>Today UAE is the worlds largest re-exporter of tea with a 60% global market share. Market experts see this trade growing in coming years. </p>
