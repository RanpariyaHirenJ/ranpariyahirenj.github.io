        <ul class="numberul">
            <li>

            <p>An individual aspiring to start the export business as a trader in tea has to obtain these documents to commence the business.</p>
            <p>Once all the registrations are ready, one can initiate communication with potential buyers or importers of tea in the target country. Once the buyers are identified and the discussions are in process, tea suppliers send a sample of the tea (s) to the buyer.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            	<strong>Guide to sending tea sample by courier</strong>
                <p>Sending the tea sample through courier is a very critical process, as most courier operators do not accept loose tea as shipment without documents.</p>
                <p class="text-bold">In order to send the sample of tea by courier from India, following documents are to be given -</p>
            	<ol>
                	<li>Invoice (As per the format required by importing countries Customs)</li>
                    <li>Packing List</li>
                    <li>Phytosanitary certificate (Issued by Plants & Quarantine Department)</li>
                    <li>Certificate of Origin (Issued by Chamber of Commerce)</li>
                    <li>Certain countries like Ukraine ask to write the content on the packet in Ukrainian language</li>
                    <li>Some countries like Czech Republic and Costa Rica require exporters to pay the custom duty even for the free sample/ items sent for personal consumption.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Inappropriate documentation for sending samples lead to clearance delays or rejections by customs in some cases. Hence for a hassle-free custom clearance process, appropriate documentation is a must. Once the sample is received & approved by the buyer ,the  commercial terms are discussed & agreed upon.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            	<strong>Pre- shipment certifications for Tea</strong>
            	<ol>
                	<li>COA ( Certificate of Analysis)</li>
                    <li>Lab Tests ( Microbial, Heavy Metals , Pesticides Levels)</li>
                    <li>SGS ( Quality certification with inspection)</li>
                    <li>Phytosanitary certificate (Issued by <a href="plantquarantineindia.nic.in" target="_blank">Plants & Quarantine Department</a>)</li>
                    <li>Certificate of Origin (Issued by <a href="https://www.indianchamber.org" target="_blank">Chamber of Commerce</a>)</li>
                    <li>RA Certification (Rainforest Alliance certificate) – Occasionally required</li>
                </ol>
                <p>When the consignment reaches the port of the importing country, it needs to fulfil the import norms of that country. Some countries like Germany, Netherlands, USA etc have very stringent parameters for the import of food items.</p>
                <p>In order to avoid rejection, tea exporters from India are advised to carry out COA ( Certificate of Analysis) or Laboratory tests from <a href="https://nabl-india.org" target="_blank">NABL</a> accredited lab in India. These generally cover various parameters like nutrient content, heavy metals, microbial analysis, residue levels. MRL (Maximum Residue Level) is the key parameter for acceptance or rejection of tea consignment from India.</p>
                <p>The laboratory tests results should be shared with the buyer prior to shipment from India. Only after securing the buyer's approval, the consignment should be loaded.</p>
            </li>
        </ul><br><br><br>
        <p>Fulfilling these criteria will make the end to end shipment a smooth process, Tea suppliers from India are now working towards expanding their presence from the traditional markets like Russia, UAE, USA to new territories in Europe like Czech Republic, Poland and the Baltic nations.</p>
        <p>Strictly following the required quality parameters will make sure the buyer is satisfied and only the best product reaches foreign ports, leading to long term repeat business.</p>
