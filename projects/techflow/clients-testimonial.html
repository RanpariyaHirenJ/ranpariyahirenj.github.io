                    <p>ADF has employed the services of Techflow Inc. on two projects currently underway, including the LaGuardia Airport Headhouse Terminal located in Queens, NY, and the West Hollywood Park project in West Hollywood, CA. Over the course of the last year, Techflow's services have been an asset to ADF's management and production teams, providing the resources and expertise required to properly detail the aforementioned projects and provide shop drawings to enable the fabrication of roughly 14,200 tons of structural steel between these two projects.</p>
                    <p>In an effort to ensure seamless coordination of issues as they arise, ADF and Techflow engage in daily coordination meetings, a service which Techflow provides free of charge, to provide ADF with fast turnaround of hot issues and alleviate impact on our fabrication operations. Techflow Inc.'s team of detailers are knowledgeable of the applicable codes and specifications that are necessary to properly detail modern steel structures and are well versed in the complexities encountered during the detailing process. In addition to the detailing services provided, Techflow Inc. also aids in flagging erection issues, particularly concerning bolt clearances or access for field welding, which allows ADF to provide a better service to our clients.</p>
                    <p>Overall, while every project has its issues, Techflow has been an asset that ADF is grateful to have on board and we look forward to continuing to work with them on future projects.</p>

The ability to be successful in this type of work requires the assistance of proven detailing partners. We have found this type of partner in TechFlow Inc. Their ability to provide drawings in a short time frame specifically aided us in an ultra-fast paced multi-building project that we successfully completed on time and within budget this year.
