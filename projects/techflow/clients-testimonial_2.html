              <p>It is always a pleasure to work with the staff at Tech-Flow. Everyone is courteous, friendly, and professional. Over the time we have been working with Tech-Flow, NuSteel has made changes to our drawing process system and they has worked with us during this change and have implemented needed changes to how we import files. They are always willing to make needed drawing changes to suit our needs, and go out of their way to help. I have worked with all the employees and have had a pleasant experience with them all. Thank you for the good work and I look forward to working with you in the near future on our next project.</p>

              <p>Tru-Line Drafting Services is a structural steel detailing firm located on the west coast of Canada. Our first exposure to Techflow was back in 2005 when we first decided to explore off-shore detailing. Although we had our ups & downs in the beginning we were able to work through them as Techflow & their management team showed an amazing ability to adapt and work through problems whether it was technical, schedule, or quality related. We have worked exclusively with Techflow over the last 9 years on approximately 140 projects and counting. Thank-you Techflow for you honesty and integrity over the years and we look forward to working with you long into the future.</p>
