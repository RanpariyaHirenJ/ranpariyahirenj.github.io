                <h1>My Experience working as Scrum Master</h1>                
                <img src="images/blog/my-experience-working-as-scrum-master-banner.jpg" class="mt_10">
              </div>
              <div class="commoncontent">  
                <p class="mt_30">We are a young start-up born in Australia for the Aussies! Our focus is limited to 3 services and just 1 geography - Australia! We are small and hence we want to be focused where our strength lies. We are not everywhere and we don't want to be everywhere.</p>
                <p class="mt_30">SYMA was started by me when I immigrated to Australia in 2016 and started working as an independent contractor at Australia’s some of the largest enterprises. I came to Australia bringing 2 decades of experience working with some of the world’s largest enterprises and less known start-up companies in India, US and UK when I landed in Australia.</p>
                <p class="mt_30">While working with large enterprises in Melbourne, I realised that there is an acute shortage of skilled people in the domain of Business Agility, Cloud Adoption and Transformation from traditional Projects and Program Management to the modern Lean Agile Ways of value driven delivery of projects and Programs. I quickly realised that enterprises are simply renaming their existing departments with the new words, existing roles into the new designations and existing process names with the new process names. For example, when I joined an enterprise as Scrum Master as an independent contractor, I was being seen as “Assistant Project Manager” who was responsible for “managing” projects and people's tasks and reporting to a Sr. Project Manager. I started building awareness about the Scrum and the role of a Scrum Master in that organisation.  When I realised that though that enterprise was using all the jargons from Agile, they were way behind the real meaning of being agile. That’s when I started coaching senior management on agile values and principles and that led me to start a coaching and transformation culture in that enterprise.</p>
                <p class="mt_30">Similarly, when I was working as an Agile Coach at another large enterprise, I saw people using jargons such as value streams, value stream leads but to my surprise, I found that value stream was just a name give to a group of people and value stream lead was just a project lead who was working totally based on command and control philosophy. This was an opportunity for me to start coaching senior management on what value streams are and what the principles are behind building a value stream.</p>
                <p class="mt_30">One more example is when I saw scrum master (project leads in real sense) telling the team members to break down stories with 1 story point and 1 story point was equal to 1 day of estimated efforts. When I challenged the project leads (scrum masters as designation), they told me that this is required to build a decent looking burn down chart as people can close stories at the end of the day everyday.</p>
                <p class="mt_30">These are a few examples why we decided to start our own boutique company that focuses one hundred percent only in 3 areas which are tightly correlated for bringing in business agility. All such experiences motivated me to build a boutique company totally focused in bringing business agility to large enterprises using SAFe and AWS.</p>
