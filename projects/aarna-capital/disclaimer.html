              <p>The value of investments and the income from them may fluctuate and go down as well as up. There is no guarantee that you will get back the amount initially invested. The value of investments may be affected by a variety of factors, including economic and political developments, interest rates and foreign exchange rates, as well as issuer-specific events. Investments denominated in currencies other than your base currency carry the risk of exchange-rate movements. A movement in exchange rates may have a separate effect, unfavourable as well as favourable, on your gains and losses. Hedging techniques may, in certain circumstances, be limited or not be successful. The market for some investments may be restricted or illiquid. There may be no readily available market and from time to time there may be difficulty in dealing in such investments or obtaining reliable information about the value and extent of risks associated with such investments. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Any trading decisions that you may make are solely your responsibility, and none of the content on this site should be taken as a personal recommendation or substitute for your own judgment.</p>
