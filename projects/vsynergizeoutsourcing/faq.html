Demand Generation is the method of acquiring the interest of the audience in what you have to sell i.e. creating demand; Lead Generation is the process of turning that procured interest into the user details i.e. Leads that you or your sales teams can follow up with. The very noticeable difference between a Demand Generation Campaign and a Lead Generation Campaign is therefore whether the campaign asks for contact information or not. If you have your content behind a form asking for contact details and distribute it to a target audience, then you are running a lead generation campaign. On the other hand, if you make content freely accessible, and then pay to distribute it to as many relevant people as you can, then you are in the business of generating demand.</p>"

								<div class="listPointer" id="tab_09">
									<p><a href="http://bit.ly/2DzE6Ol" target="_blank">Demand Generation and Lead Generation</a> are both highly important for B2B Marketing Strategies. Demand Generation is the method of acquiring the interest of the audience in what you have to sell i.e. creating demand; Lead Generation is the process of turning that procured interest into the user details i.e. Leads that you or your sales teams can follow up with. The very noticeable difference between a Demand Generation Campaign and a Lead Generation Campaign is therefore whether the campaign asks for contact information or not. If you have your content behind a form asking for contact details and distribute it to a target audience, then you are running a lead generation campaign. On the other hand, if you make content freely accessible, and then pay to distribute it to as many relevant people as you can, then you are in the business of generating demand.</p>
