								<div class="listPointer" id="tab_01">
									<p>Here are five strategies that will help you create better forms for you to <a href="http://bit.ly/2TQobT4" target="_blank">lead generation</a> activities:</p>
                                    <ul class="list arrow">
                                    	<li>Filling forms are boring! Make them interactive</li>
                                        <li>Lesser form fields to fill, the better</li>
                                        <li>Placement of form matters</li>
                                        <li>Try different types of forms</li>
                                        <li>Get your privacy policies in place</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>But, the trick is to craft a landing page that is well-read with a thoughtfully designed conversion form. If the landing page is not interesting enough, then there is a high chance of losing a potential conversion.</p>
