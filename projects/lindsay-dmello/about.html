        	<h2>ABOUT</h2>
            <p>Equipped with only a drum kit, Lindsay worked through all the music he was getting exposed to. A chance encounter with a friend later led him to play heavy metal with Bombay based 'Witch Hammer', who played as often as they could.</p>

        	<p>Dinshah Sanjana, a jazz fusion composer, took notice of the band during a concert at Rang Bhavan, a historic venue in the city. Lindsay as part of his band 'Divya', played the Thailand Jazz Festival in 95' alongside performances by Courtney Pine, Eric Marienthal, Sergio Mendes, Othello Molineaux and Randy Brecker among others.</p>
            <p class="mb0">The advent of Hindi pop saw artists like Lucky Ali and Shaan using him on their gigs in India and abroad. These would be a platform in the later years to play with artists such as KK and Vishal-Shekhar with the latter he would play sold out venues such as Nassau Coliseum and O2 arena on the successful <strong>'Unforgettable Tour' backing film legend, Amitabh Bachchan</strong></p>

            	<p>This led to many energetic gigs with bands such as Gil Gallad's Funkadelik Arcade which would later evolve into <strong>Bombay Black a collective of musicians and friends who produced, performed and created experimental music.</strong> They are still active today.</p>
                <p>Bombay Black is a live act that at the time, brought samplers, computers and electronica into a scene primarily dominated by rock. This was followed by the release of two CD's; both were critically acclaimed and gave the band an opportunity at the Inland Invasion festival in Los Angeles alongside acts such as Aerosmith.</p>
                <p class="mb0">Only recently, Bombay Black reformed with the original lineup releasing an album called 'Snow White and the Seven Bungalows' which was also received favorably.</p>

        	<h2>Groove Suppa</h2>
        	<p>An opportunity to play at the Jazzmandu Festival in Nepal led to the formation of Groove Suppa who went on to play at the festival thrice and released a self titled album. </p>
