            <p>The sport of badminton has its origins in ancient civilisations in Europe and Asia.  The ancient game known as battledore (bat or paddle) and shuttlecock probably originated more than 2000 years ago.</p>
              <p>In the 1600s Battledore and Shuttlecock was an upper class pastime in England and many European countries. Battledore and Shuttlecock was simply two people hitting a shuttlecock backwards and forwards with a simple bat as many times as they could without allowing it to hit the ground.</p>

                                    <p>Playing cards were invented in Imperial China. They were found in China as early as the 9th century during the Tang dynasty (618â€“907). The first reference to card games dates from the 9th century, when the Collection of Miscellanea at Duyang, written by Tang dynasty writer Su E, described Princess Tongchang, daughter of Emperor Yizong of Tang, playing the "leaf game" in 868 with members of the Wei clan, the family of the princess' husband.
                        The Club provides an amiable environment for playing cards. "<strong>Bridge" is by far the favourite game amongst Bengal Club Members.</strong>

            <p>The game of carrom is believed to have originated from the Indian subcontinent. Although no concrete evidence is available, it is believed that carrom was invented by the Indian Maharajas. One Carrom Board with its surface made of glass is still available in one of the palaces in Patiala, India.[1] It became very popular among the masses after World War I. State level competitions were being held in different States of India during early part of the nineteenth century</p>
